# Survey360 ðŸ“‹

A tool to gather 360Â° feedback from your colleagues, so you can do an even better job in the future. ðŸš€

Also my personal project to learn SurveyJS. ðŸ˜‰

### Rationale

Most 360Â° feedback guides will tell you how important it is to gather feedback anonymously. I disagree: if your company
culture does not permit open and constructive feedback, then you have other things to worry about and do before you can 
switch to a routine feedback process.

The premise for this survey is simple: I assume that everyone wants to do their job in the best way possible and help
their colleagues to do the same! Be excellent to each other, so you can excel as a team.

For that to work, everyone needs to be aware there is always room for improvement and that even the best intentions
might get lost in translation - i.e. communication; or that even a well-considered decision was, after all, lacking
some important bit of information for it to work out as originally intended.

The questions in the survey are a guide to start and structure *a dialog* between both parties which might eventually
not even require additional prompting by any survey. In that regard, this tools purpose is to make itself unnecessary.
